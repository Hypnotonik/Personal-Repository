# Legal Issues

### Copyright Infringement
Using copyrighted images, text, or anything else relevent is an issue. I circumvent this issue I will only be using ideas created by me.

### Trademarks
This kind of goes off of copyright. Using trademarked names or logo's is a no go. Specifically to my project using the names of already existing characters or ideas alike. I will be avoiding this problem by make all new characters, new world, ect.

### Plagiarism
The act of stealing something and claiming it as my own. I will not being stealing any code of any sort and will be making every freshly as my own code.
