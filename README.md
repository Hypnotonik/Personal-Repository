# Ethical Issues

### Content and Themes
In my text based RPG there could be the problem of sensitive topics brought up. Things such as violence, sexual content, or discriminiation. These are all things that could put off a user of my game. The best way I can avoid any of it is not adding it in the first place. Howeve, with the nature of my game being an RPG it will be impossible to not have any violence. As such if I cannot avoid it, I could always add a warning for the user before they actually get into the game.

Another thing is trigger warnings for anything that may trigger someone. Ill avoid adding anything into my game that could even cause a trigger. In the case of not being able to avoid it I will instead warn the user to make sure they understand what they are getting in to.

### Data Privacy
When ever anyone on the internet is interacting with something they should be concerned about their data privacy. With my text based rpg, you will not be connecting to the internet, and no data will be store on servers. As such the only data of the player will be a save file (if there is one). The save file will only store data on the player's game, and nothing else
